## Fractal
Digichain’s debut product is Fractal, a revolutionary new digital service. Much like the infinitely repeating fractals of mathematics, Fractal utilizes a global network of devices to offer its services. Here’s how the app works:
1. Clients (expected to be scientific researchers and big data corporations) pay a fee to securely send Fractal large volumes of data that needs to be processed and analyzed.
2. When an individual who has downloaded Fractal has a phone that is at 100% battery capacity, charging, and idle, Fractal downloads a small chunk of encrypted data to be processed and processed the data on the phone.
3. The individual who processed the data earns rewards proportional to the amount of data processed.
4. When our user bases’ network of devices has collectively processed all the data, the processed files are securely sent back to the client.
